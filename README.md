## Introduction
Wimbee is built to streamline online meetings by offering an AI-powered avatar that actively participates in discussions. It aims to reduce meeting fatigue, enhance productivity, and ensure key insights are documented effectively.

## Problem Statement
### Challenges in Online Meetings:
- Time constraints & multitasking
- Information overload
- Inefficient meeting summaries
- Difficulty in tracking actionable outcomes

### Virtual Assistant Advantages:
- Enhances productivity & time management
- Provides meeting summaries & action items
- Ensures flexibility & accessibility
- Enables data-driven decision-making

## Features
### Core Functionalities:
- **Speech Recognition & Synthesis**: Converts speech to text and generates human-like responses.
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Understands context, intent, and nuances.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Maintains meeting history and adapts to discussions.
- **Adaptive Communication**: Mimics user tone, language, and formality.
- **Multi-Platform Compatibility**: Integrates with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet.
- **Data Privacy & Security**: Complies with privacy laws and ensures secure communication.
- **Actionable Outcomes**: Summarizes meetings, lists action items, and sends follow-ups.

## Technical Implementation
### Architecture:
1. **Speech-to-Text**: Converts spoken words into textual data.
2. **Large Language Model (LLM) Processing**: Generates relevant responses based on the discussion.
3. **Text-to-Speech**: Synthesizes text into human-like speech.
4. **Meeting Context Tracking**: Keeps track of previous discussions.
5. **Integration with Conferencing Tools**: Seamlessly joins meetings and interacts.

### Technologies Used:
- **LLMs (Finetuned Mistral Model)**
- **LangChain Framework**
- **Google Colab for Development**
- **Vector Store for Context Management**
